- Kotiak (made shit/nothing done, is ghosting JPmánek and Mrtmoi, demoted JPman from founder of FrWebs to Admin of FrWebs ==> JPman angwy + MrTomiCZ angwy cuz it is second time *MrTomiCZ and JPman are angwy, Kotiak is trapped in basement by JPman and Mrtmoi, after some time Kotiak escapes from basement trought window*. *mrtmoi clears throat and continues* but he didn't get far. Mrtmoi and JPman went searching for him, and sure enough, they found Kotiak sleeping on a bench at a local supermarket. *JPman says: "There you are! you are going right back in that basement!"*. Little did Kotiak know that there was increased security from last time. Iron bars everywhere, windows blocked up with concrete, and a lot of similar stuff. Eventually, he got out again after 2 years of trying. BUT there was a twist. Right as he crawled out of that window, an alarm was heard all across the house, and even the garden. He didn't make it in time. *chatgépété continues* *The alarm blared loudly, red lights flashing in every hallway of the house. JPman and Mrtmoi were already running toward the basement, alerted by the sensors installed just days earlier.* Kotiak, now panicking, sprinted across the garden, but his legs were weak from the years of captivity. *Suddenly, a drone buzzed to life above him, locking onto his heat signature.* "Target acquired," it chirped in a cold robotic voice. *Kotiak ducked behind a hedge, panting heavily.* Just when he thought he had evaded it, a net shot out from the drone and tangled around his legs, dragging him across the grass. *JPman and Mrtmoi arrived moments later, slightly out of breath but grinning with satisfaction.* *JPman walks up and says:* "You really thought you could escape twice? You're not that guy, pal." *Mrtmoi nods and adds:* "This time, the window leads to a wall." *They haul Kotiak back inside, past multiple locked doors, fingerprint scanners, and a hallway that just loops back on itself if you take a wrong turn.* The new cell is deeper underground, with a reinforced steel door and a 24/7 live feed sent straight to JPman's phone. Kotiak sighs. *"Maybe next time,"* he whispers.)
